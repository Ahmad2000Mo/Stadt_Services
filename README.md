# City Services â€“ School Project: Multi-API Integration

This project was developed as a Uni project in my computer science studies, with the main goal of practicing the use of multiple public and external APIs. The application connects to various APIs to demonstrate how modern web apps can aggregate and present real-time data from different sources.

**Key Idea:**  
Users can select a German city or district and access a variety of information, all powered by different APIs: statistics, weather, news, city images, holidays, and more.

**What the project demonstrates:**
- Practical use and integration of several external APIs
- Processing and visualization of live data from multiple sources
- Dynamic UI with modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Data handling with JSON and API requests

**Note:**  
The project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes, showcasing different possibilities for web API integration.
